# Challenge Description {#descr}

Decrypt the message and get the flag.

Donâ€™t forget to put it into the brackets and add CTF.

# Summary {#summary}

Binary to anode 7 segment display

# Details {#details}

We get a file with a bunch of binary data. Upon analysing it we realise the following:

- The bytes are grouped by **7**
- There are **17** different ways they are grouped, meaning [0-9a-f], exactly like the flag should look like
- There are **64** of them, enough for the entire flag.

This means that each of the binary chunks represent one letter in the flag.

Taking a hint from the title of the challenge, we realise that we are talking about something `digital`. One of the things that came to mind was the *7 segment display.*

I then used [https://www.dcode.fr/7-segment-display](https://www.dcode.fr/7-segment-display) to decode the binary data, and I got:

I made the text lowercase and submitted the flag.
