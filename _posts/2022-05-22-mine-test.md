# Summary {#summary}

Search the map database to find all signs and their text

# Details {#details}

We get a bunch of files for a game called `minetest`, and we have to find a secret, somewhere. The first thing I tried to do was downloading the game (using `brew`) and running the world with a player called `Splasher` (found in the logs file).

We spawned on top of a sign, saying `Try harder`. To find the flag, we thought that we had to search for all of the signs in the map and read them all.

We generated a top view of the map, which didnâ€™t help much:

We then started going through the world files and found `map.sqlite`, which, according to the `minetest` documentation, contains information about the blocks (nodes of 16x16x16) that have been generated.

We opened it up and we found `pos` and `data` for all blocks:

Afterwards, we read the official documentation for how these rows get filled:

[https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/master/doc/world_format.txt](https://github.com/minetest/minetest/blob/master/doc/world_format.txt)

Byte:

Apparently, the bytes are zipped using `zstd` (not zlib), after being serialized.

I created a simple script to get all of the data and unzip it(skipping the first byte), then tried searching for just blocks that have a `sign` in them.

```python
import os
import sqlite3

c = sqlite3.connect('map.sqlite')
rows = c.execute('SELECT data FROM blocks')
for row in rows:
    a = row[0][1:]
    with open('res.zst', 'wb') as y:
        y.write(a)
    os.system("zstd -d res.zst")
    with open('res', 'rb') as y:
        a = y.read()
        if b'sign' in a.lower():
            print(a)
    os.system('rm res')
```

After running this script for a while, we got two results. At the end of the first result, there was the flag:

`\x00\x00\x00\x03\x00\x08formspec\x00\x00\x00\x14field[text;;${text}]\x00\x00\x04text\x00\x00\x00\x1fCTF{this_was_a_hidden_room_lol}\x00\x00\x08infotext\x00\x00\x003\x1b(T@default)"\x1bFCTF{this_was_a_hidden_room_lol}\x1bE"\x1bE\x00EndInventory\n\x00\x00\x00\n\x00\x00'`

The second result was the initial `Try harder` sign.
